         "info":"Adopt Me is a roleplay game made by DreamCraft and can be considered a spiritual successor to Adopt and Raise a Baby!. The game features two parties, a baby and a parent. The parent must care for the baby. There are other features, like obbies, pets and customizable houses.\nOn May 4, 2019, the game reached 1 billion place visits, making it the 7th game to surpass that mark.\nThe following interview was between Thundermaker300 and NewFissy on , as part of the Developer Connections Project..\nWhat was it like developing Adopt Me?It's a lot of fun! Adopt Me is an enjoyable creative and technical challenge for both me and my co-creator Bethink. It's been an immense growth opportunity as well and has definitely pushed my programming to the next level. The great thing about working on a roleplay game is that there are limitless features you can add, since roleplay is pretty much a simulation of the real world.What challenges did you have to overcome while developing? What was the most challenging?\nWe're constantly adding new features, but a lot of times that means our existing codebase doesn't have the capabilities we need to support the new stuff. We've rewritten our code 3-4 times now. And we're working through a major rewrite of our avatar system right now. When working with a codebase with 50,000+ lines of code, it can be difficult to make broad-sweeping changes, so we build automated tools and macros to rewrite and refactor our code. The biggest issue that we ran into is that many of our favorite tools don't work within Roblox Studio, so we needed a way to sync our code to the filesystem so we could use the full suite of tools. To solve this issue, we built a program called Rosync that does a snapshot sync to the filesystem so the code can be manipulated with traditional tools like git and vim macros.\nWhat did you enjoy most while developing Adopt Me?\nI have and always will be a software engineer at heart. I do enjoy the creative aspect of game dev like dreaming up new items and designing UIs, but nothing beats the feeling of hitting Play and your beautifully architected code that abstracts complexity into simple units works perfectly.\nIs there anything else you'd like to share?\nI've been working on Roblox for nearly a decade, and it's been incredible to see the platform grow from my childhood sandbox to this mainstream platform that's conquering the world. Keep it up Roblox!"

         "info":"Both teams spawn in their house, which they can customize to their heart's content. Babies and parents can ask (not request) nearby players to be a part of their family them by pressing [E] on a computer or tablet, or [click to send request] on a mobile. Or they can create their own family by going to the family GUI and then clicking 'Create Family'.\nWhen a baby or a parent accepts a player invite to be their family, both the baby and the parent will have a GUI. If there are multiple babies in the family, the baby that was held first's GUI's will show up for the parent. That GUI is for the baby's needs. There are four of these needs the parent must tend to, otherwise, the baby will be unhappy. These needs are represented as bars, slowly shrinking as time passes. The lower the GUI of the baby is, the lower the daily paycheck the parent will receive. The four needs are:\n   1. Hunger - How hungry the baby or pet is, can be increased by feeding formula, food from the supermarket or Ramsay's Pizzeria.\n   2. Fun - How active the baby or pet is, can be increased by going to the park or shaking rattles.\n   3. Cleanliness - How clean the baby or pet is, can be increased by swimming or taking a shower in a house or in the Gym.\n   4. Sleepiness - How tired the baby is, can only be increased by placing the baby in the bed.\n   After the pets update, players can adopt pets, including basic ones likes dog and cats, or rare pets such as wolves, griffins, unicorns, etc. Pets have the same moods as babies and they can be taught tricks by the pet trainer at the school. Babies cannot hold pets or put pets in strollers, but parents can.\n   There is an in-game currency called money, which can be used to buy strollers, toys, pet supplies, furniture, etc. As a baby, you gain money by having your parent take care of you. As a parent, you gain money by taking care of your baby.\nCRITICISM & TRIVIA\nCRITICISM\nSome people have criticized this game for being too similar to games such as Life in Paradise and Adopt and Raise a Cute Kid[citation needed]. It is also criticized because of how frequent online daters join this game[citation needed]. It's also been hated due to a “cannibalistic” thumbnail that has since been taken down[citation needed].\nTRIVIA\nAdopt Me! was mainly updated in the Family Update, which caused it to stay in the Popular Page on Roblox."

You can get your pets in many different ways, but if you’re a free-to-play player, then it can be a bit difficult to collect them! Read below to take a look at all the ways you can get pets for free in&nbsp;<em>Adopt Me</em>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Ways to Get Pets for Free in Adopt Me</span></strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">To get free pets in&nbsp;<em>Adopt Me</em>, you can either obtain them via events, star rewards, or gaining bucks and purchasing eggs! We’re going to go into more detail on how to use these methods. Read below and get yourself some free pets!</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Starter Egg</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">When you first start out in the game, talk to Sir Woofington at the Nursery and he will give you a Starter Egg. You need to go complete objectives to hatch your egg, such as feeding it.&nbsp; Once you do, you will get the choice of a Dog or Cat! Choose wisely because you only get one chance, and the pet you get from it is not able to be traded.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Star Rewards</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Star Rewards are a great way to obtain free pets! All you need to do is log in every day to earn stars. The more you log in, the more stars you will accumulate. You can see on the Star Rewards catalog that after you collect a certain amount of stars, you have a few options for pets.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-401 size-full\" src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought1.jpg' alt='' width=\"723\" height=\"362\" srcset='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought1.jpg 723w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought1.jpg 300w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought1.jpg 400w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought1.jpg 160w' sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Once you’ve collected 210 stars, you can purchase yourself a Ginger Cat. If you save up 400 stars, you can get a Toucan. 550 stars will get you a Starfish. With 660 stars, you can get a Golden Egg that will give you either a Golden Unicorn, Golden Dragon, or Golden Griffin!</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Earning Bucks and Purchasing Eggs</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">The final and most typical option for obtaining pets without spending real money or Robux is to earn money in-game to purchase eggs! There’s a variety of ways to earn money: paychecks, login bonuses, objectives, money trees, and more.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Paychecks are given periodically while you are playing the game. You get 20 bucks every 10 – 15 minutes you are actively logged into the game. So, if you want to just earn money throughout the day, try and keep the game open in the background and check back once in a while to collect your check!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-402 size-full\" src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought8.jpg' alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"358\" srcset='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought8.jpg 720w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought8.jpg 300w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought8.jpg 400w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought8.jpg 161w' sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">You should be logging in every day for the star rewards, but you also get a fair amount of bucks for each day you jump into the game in a row. Make sure to open up the game at least once per day to continue the streak and get more and more money! Every five days you will get a gift and a bonus amount of stars. On your 30th day, you will receive a Cracked Egg that you can hatch for a pet!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">You get 6-7 bucks per blue objective you complete. Things like showering, feeding, and giving your pet something to drink are blue objectives. Orange objectives give you 12 bucks, so make sure to do them when they are available! These usually require you to head to specific locations (like the campsite or school) and hang out there for a brief period.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Money trees are an item you can place in your home that will periodically grow bucks on it. Once it does, you can harvest and get 8 dollars each time. You can have multiple money trees, but can only collect a maximum of 100 bucks per day.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-403 size-full\" src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought3.jpg' alt=\"\" width=\"722\" height=\"361\" srcset='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought3.jpg 722w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought3.jpg 300w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought3.jpg 400w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought3.jpg 160w' sizes=\"(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Once you’ve got a fair bit of cash you can purchase an egg from the Nursery. There are multiple different eggs that can be purchased at different prices. If the egg is a higher price, that usually means you get a higher chance at getting a more valuable pet.</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><strong>350 Bucks:</strong>&nbsp;Cracked Egg</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><strong>600 Bucks:</strong>&nbsp;Pet Egg</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><strong>1,450 Bucks:</strong>&nbsp;Royal Egg</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">There are also special event eggs that you can purchase! At the time of this writing, you can get yourself an Ocean&nbsp; Egg that will cost you 750 bucks. These special eggs generally will only have a particular set of themed pets, so make sure they are something you want before purchasing!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><strong>For a detailed guide on making bucks in&nbsp;<em>Adopt Me</em>, check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gamebai-doithuong.com/adopt-me-get-all-pets-list/\">How to Get Money Guide</a>!</strong></span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Hacks &amp; Codes</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">There’s a lot of talk about hacks that you can use to get pets in&nbsp;<em>Adopt Me</em>. These don’t work and are likely some kind of malware/virus that someone is trying to get you to install. Never trust these methods, because even if one of them happened to work you are likely to get your account banned!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">People talking about codes in&nbsp;<em>Adopt Me</em>.&nbsp;<strong>There are currently&nbsp;no codes available&nbsp;in the game right now</strong>. There’s no location to enter a code in the game at the moment, so don’t believe anyone saying there are codes until it is announced via&nbsp;<em>Adopt Me</em>&nbsp;on social media or in the game!</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">“Free” Pets on YouTube</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">You may see YouTube videos claiming you can get a “free” pet. This usually means they are giving away a pet, and you have to join the contest somehow. If the YouTuber is reputable and well-known, there’s a possibility you could win the pet but it’s a very small chance. If the requirement for entry is something simple like commenting on a video, feel free to enter for a chance to win, but don’t get your hopes up!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">If they are asking you to signup somewhere, pay money, or give away personal info, use extreme caution. These “giveaways” could actually be a scam.<strong>&nbsp;Always be wary when interacting with people playing&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>&nbsp;who demand money or personal details.&nbsp;</strong></span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">No Longer Available</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">There are some pets that are only obtainable through events and other limited-time settings. Here is a list of pets that you cannot get any more. These pets may make a return, but as of the writing of this article, they are unavailable.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Easter 2020: Free Chick Pet</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">During the&nbsp;Roblox Easter Egg Hunt for 2020, you could get a free Chick pet. You needed to hop into the game and press the Easter button that appeared on the side of your screen. You would hatch the egg as you do normally and earn the Chick. This pet does not have the ability to be traded, so it is truly unavailable.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">April Fools’ 2020: Pet Rock</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">The Pet Rock was a joke pet that could be obtained by visiting the Nursery during April Fools’. It was only available for a limited time and then disappeared from the owners’ inventory. It is not available for trade, since no one owns the Pet Rock.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">May 2020: Scoob&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Scoob was a pet designed after the famous dog, Scooby-Doo.

Here’s a look at the items required for each special Monkey:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><strong>Business Monkey:</strong>&nbsp;3 Briefcases (Rare)</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><strong>Toy Monkey:</strong>&nbsp;3 Cymbals (Rare)</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><strong>Ninja Monkey:</strong>&nbsp;3 Scrolls (Ultra-Rare)</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><strong>Monkey King:</strong>&nbsp;3 Staffs (Legendary)</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><strong>I’m getting a lot of questions about how to get these items, and it is explained here:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">The briefcase, cymbal, and scroll can all be gotten in the regular Monkey Box. If you want the Monkey King, however, you can only get the staff out of a Premium Monkey Box. If you have an Albino Monkey, it will look different in its changed form than a regular Monkey. You can also trade other players to get the items you need, which I discuss further down the page.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Here’s what each of the special Monkeys looks like:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-413 size-full\" src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought12.jpg' alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"409\" srcset='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought12.jpg 768w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought12.jpg 300w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought12.jpg 150w' sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-414 size-full\" src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought13.jpg' alt=\"\" width=\"757\" height=\"387\" srcset='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought13.jpg 757w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought13.jpg 300w, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnhPhamRepository/AdoptMeNews/master/walkthrought13.jpg 156w' sizes=\"(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px\"></span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Trading Items</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">The best way to get three of the items you want to transform a Monkey would be to trade with other players. You will need to be careful though, because this game has a lot of people attempting to scam you. Items CAN’T be traded if they are equipped to the pet. You will only receive an item if it is IN the trade window when you confirm a trade. Here’s what the official Adopt Me patch notes say about it:”<strong>Be careful when trading them! Pet Accessories are never traded equipped on the pets. If you’re trading for a Monkey and want the accessories that come with them, make sure the accessories are put in the trading window individually.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Instead of buying a ton of boxes, try to find someone with the item you want and trade them an item they want! This would be a much more efficient way to get the items you need to make your favorite Monkey friend!</span></p></div></div></article></main></div></body></html>"

Many people here on the wiki are experienced traders and know the worth of items. We will not hesitate to help you out with any of your trading worries. If youd like to know if you made a fair trade, ask on the Discussion page! Value of an item, ask on the Discussion page! Anything else about Adopt Me!… ask on the Discussion page! </span><br><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;\">Tip 2: Dont Be Impatient or Rude When trading, most people wont trade with you if you are rude and pushy. If they are trading you and youre pushy, then they might not accept the trade. Always be nice when trading. If you decide they dont want to trade, dont pester them or ask why or try to change their mind because that will probably not make them want to trade with you anymore. If they dont want to trade anymore, just say okay, maybe thank them, and get on with your life.</span></p></div></div></article></main></div></body></html>"
